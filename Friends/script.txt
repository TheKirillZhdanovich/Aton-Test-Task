CHANDLER: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realise I am totally naked.
CHANDLER: Then I look down, and I realise there's a phone... there.
JOEY: Instead of...?
CHANDLER: That's right.
JOEY: Never had that dream.
PHOEBE: No.
CHANDLER: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because- she never calls me!
ROSS: (MORTIFIED) Hi.
JOEY: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
MONICA: Are you okay, sweetie?
ROSS: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
CHANDLER: Cookie?
MONICA: (EXPLAINING TO THE OTHERS) Carol moved her stuff out today. (TO ROSS) Let me get you some coffee.
PHOEBE: Ooh! Oh! (STARTS TO PLUCK AT THE AIR JUST IN FRONT OF ROSS)
ROSS: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
MONICA: No you don't.
ROSS: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
JOEY: And you never knew she was a lesbian...
ROSS: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
CHANDLER: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (THE OTHERS STARE AT HIM) Did I say that out loud?
JOEY: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
